## üß† AI Support and Learning Outcomes (AI Usage)

During the development of this project, **Google Gemini (Google AI)** was utilized to address specific technical challenges and enhance the overall project quality.  
The AI acted not only as a **bug fixer**, but also as a **technical consultant** and **language editor** throughout the process.

### üéØ Key Technical and Professional Learning Outcomes

| Topic / Challenge Area | Critical Learning Outcome Gained with AI Guidance |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dynamic JS Integration (OpenLayers)** | **Problem:** In a multi-page website, the map library (`ol.js`) loaded only on the `contact.html` page caused runtime JavaScript errors on other pages. <br> **Solution:** A dual-condition wrapper (`if (typeof ol !== 'undefined')` and `if (mapElement)`) was added in the `script.js` file, ensuring the map code executes only when both the library and required DOM element are available. This significantly improved the **robustness** of the application. |
| **Browser Debugging (Error Detection)** | Identified that the critical `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` browser error was caused by **case sensitivity in file names** across different operating systems. This experience reinforced the importance of matching file paths (e.g., `href`, `src`) exactly with their names on disk. |
| **Professional Content Development** | With AI support, project portfolio texts were refined to maintain a professional tone aligned with **Geomatics Engineering** terminology. The AI-assisted revision helped ensure linguistic accuracy and balance between academic and industry-oriented communication. |
